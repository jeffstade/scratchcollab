Hi guys. I'm a Scratcher. Like literally, i scratch where ever when ever! Sometimes my face and sometimes my toes and some times, i scratch places too rude to be written on this ""about me"" square.

","

Alright guys. Currently, i'm working on nothing. But soon i will be working on something. And when i am, i'll let you all know... (:
