Down bellow are the jobs that are required.Programmer:In order to become a Programmer, you will have to basically program the game, to make the stuff other's do become a finished project. As many as needed are requested, however, if you can do another job, we need some of everything. Programmers will be responsible for programming the characters, linking everything together, programming the scrolling of the map, collision detection. Text boxes, basically, turning it from a mess of graphics, sounds, and more into a finished project. If you are one, please do NOT steal code from other's projects. However, you can take code from your own projects.Story WriterThe Story Writer's will be in charge of creating the story, and all story-related quests. Typically, one or two will be in charge of the regular story, and a third person for text boxes, etc.Graphic Designer:I want the game to look like the fable games. I want it to look like a halo graphics. It should look real yet cartoon like.Music Writer:Whoever is in charge of this job, will be responsible for making a few tracks.

\Quality beats quantityPost count is being abused. Many Scratchers are simply saying “no support” or “support” without leaving any reasons. Others are simply quoting posts without adding their opinion. Make sure that your post adds something important to the thread. Post count isn't a race, it's not a competition.
